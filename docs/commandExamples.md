This will create a new repeating events with 1 repeat count and 60 seconds delay everytime Channel1 becomes 1. Basically, it will automatically turn off the light 60 seconds after you turn it on. TODO: clear previous event instance?

This simple timer will toggle LED state every 5 seconds. -1 hear means infinite repeats. The ! stands for negation and $led_enableAll is a constant that you can read to get 0 or 1. It works like $CH11, $CH4 etc (any number) for accessing channel value
<br>```addRepeatingEvent 5 -1 led_enableAll !$led_enableAll```<br>
